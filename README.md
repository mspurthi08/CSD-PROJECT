INTRODUCTION

Music has become a vital aspect of our lives in the digital age. It can provoke a variety of feelings, including inspiration and happiness as well as calmness and reflection. Finding the ideal song to fit our mood, though, is frequently a difficult undertaking. When attempting to find music that corresponds with their emotional state, people may feel overwhelmed by the multitude of genres and recordings that are available. Groove Guide is one such web application that was created in response to this challenge to address the issue of ineffective music discovery.

ABOUT THE PROJECT 

Our project was developed to improve how people find and use music. The idea behind the project is that music has the ability to significantly affect feelings. Users of Groove Guide can enter feelings or moods they're experiencing, such as happy, sad, angry, relaxed, etc. The vast music library of Spotify is then accessed by it to offer customized song and playlist recommendations. Users can enjoy music that elevates their present emotional state by selecting a song that is suggested to them based on how they are feeling.
